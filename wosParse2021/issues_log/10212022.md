# Duplicates (wosID)
Duplicates are present in the dataset, because records are potentially added to the dataset in more than one year or file. To deal with this, we drop duplicates early on (at the creation of the wos4 variable)

Duplicates are created at the join action. This is because there are several dataframes created, that then are joined with a full join. 

# Postgres Transformations
In the workflow that was inherited, there is a step to insert all records into a Postgres to create a lowercase standard names column from the original standard names column. This was replaced by creating the lowercase standard names column within the spark parse script.
